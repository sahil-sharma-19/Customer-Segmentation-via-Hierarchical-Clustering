# Customer-Segmentation-via-Hierarchical-Clustering
Hierarchical Clustering Analysis groups customers based on annual income and spending score using dendrograms and agglomerative clustering. The project includes data exploration, visualization, and Python implementation, helping identify customer segments for targeted marketing and business insights.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core programming language used for data analysis and modeling.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and preprocessing.
- **NumPy**: Numerical computations.
- **Matplotlib**: Data visualization (dendrograms, scatter plots).
- **SciPy**: Hierarchical clustering and dendrogram generation.
- **scikit-learn**: Agglomerative clustering for segmenting customers.

## Data Source Information

- The dataset consists of 200 customer records from a mallâ€™s customer database.
- Each record includes: CustomerID, Genre, Age, Annual Income (k$), and Spending Score (1-100).
- Data is used to segment customers based on spending behavior and income for targeted marketing.
- Original data file: `data/customers.csv`

### Sample Data Preview

| CustomerID | Genre  | Age | Annual Income (k$) | Spending Score (1-100) |
|------------|--------|-----|--------------------|------------------------|
| 1          | Male   | 19  | 15                 | 39                     |
| 2          | Male   | 21  | 15                 | 81                     |
| 3          | Female | 20  | 16                 | 6                      |
| ...        | ...    | ... | ...                | ...                    |
| 200        | Male   | 30  | 137                | 83                     |
